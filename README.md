<h2 align=center> Hi, my name is Ergi ðŸ‘‹ </h2>

I'm a software engineer [@division5](https://www.linkedin.com/company/division5/) working primarily with web applications. My favourite programming language is Javascript, but I also have prior experience with PHP and Go(which I've been working with recently). Contributing to open source projects and knowledge sharing is something I really enjoy and most of the time I'd be reading articles or hands-on trying things.

As I mentioned, I'm currently working on my skills in Go. So, if there's any project you need help with or something you wanna try, I'd gladly help with that.

How to reach me:
