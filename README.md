### Hi, my name is Ergi Berdellima ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer working primarily with web applications. My favourite programming language is Javascript, but I also have prior experience with PHP and Go(which I've been working with recently). Contributing to open source projects and knowledge sharing is something I really enjoy and most of the time I'd be reading articles or hands-on trying things.

As I mentioned, I'm currently working on my skills in Go. So, if there's any project you need help with or something you wanna try, I'd gladly help with that.
